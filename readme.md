# Data Science for Business project
This is the repository for the laboratories.
During this first laboratory we worked separately one two dataset, cleaning and exploring them.
Our idea is to extract useful information each other, and then compare and interleave our results to discover correlations and insights from people that activate and cease labours.

# Notes
If you want to **run** the two jupyter notebooks remember to install the requirements with the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
